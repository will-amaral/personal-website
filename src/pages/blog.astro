  <h1>Blog</h1>
  <p>
    Exploring the intersection of tech and education. I write about
    <strong>Elixir</strong>, <strong>React patterns</strong>, and
    <strong>making complex systems approachable</strong>. Posts alternate
    between English and Portuguese â€” bonus points if you read both!
  </p>
  <p><em>Migrating archives gradually. Fresh posts weekly!</em></p>
